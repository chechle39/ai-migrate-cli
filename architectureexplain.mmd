%% Diagram 1
The provided PHP file is a mix of view and controller logic. It doesn't follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern strictly, as it lacks a separate model layer. However, we can still extract a high-level architecture flow from it.

Here's the flow in Mermaid.js format:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant View as add-appointment.php
    participant Controller as PHP_SELF
    participant DB as Database

    User->>View: Accesses add-appointment.php
    View->>Controller: Form submission (POST)
    Controller->>DB: Connects to Database
    DB-->>Controller: Connection status
    Controller->>DB: Sends SQL Query
    DB-->>Controller: Query execution status
    Controller->>View: Displays result message
    View-->>User: Shows result message
```

This diagram represents the sequence of interactions between the user, the view (add-appointment.php), the controller (embedded PHP code within the same file), and the database. The user accesses the page, submits the form, the PHP code connects to the database, executes the SQL query, and finally, the result is displayed back to the user.

%% Diagram 2
The given PHP file is a mix of view and controller logic, and it directly interacts with the database. There is no explicit model layer in this code. However, we can still infer a high-level architecture flow.

Here's the Mermaid.js sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant View as add-doctor.php (View)
    participant DB as Database
    User->>View: Accesses page
    View->>DB: Connects to database
    DB-->>View: Connection established
    View->>DB: Queries for max doctor id
    DB-->>View: Returns max doctor id
    User->>View: Submits form
    View->>DB: Inserts new doctor record
    DB-->>View: Returns result
    View-->>User: Displays result
```

Please note that in a more structured MVC architecture, the database operations would be handled by a separate model layer, and the controller would mediate between the view and the model.

%% Diagram 3
Based on the provided PHP file, the architecture flow can be represented as follows:

1. Route: The route is the URL path that the user navigates to in their browser. In this case, the route is `add-patient.php`.

2. Controller: The controller is the PHP code that handles the HTTP request and response. In this case, the controller is the PHP code within the `add-patient.php` file. This code handles the form submission, connects to the database, and executes the SQL query.

3. Model: The model represents the data structure. In this case, the model is the `patient` table in the database. The fields of the `patient` table are `patientID`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `gender`, and `address`.

4. Database (DB): The database is where the data is stored. In this case, the database is `hospital`, and the data is stored in the `patient` table.

The Mermaid.js representation of this architecture flow is:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Route as add-patient.php
    participant Controller as PHP Code
    participant Model as patient Table
    participant DB as hospital Database
    Route->>Controller: HTTP Request (POST)
    Controller->>Model: SQL Query (INSERT)
    Model->>DB: Data Insertion
    DB-->>Controller: Query Result
    Controller-->>Route: HTTP Response
```

This diagram shows the sequence of interactions between the route, controller, model, and database when a new patient is added.

%% Diagram 4
The provided PHP file is a standalone script that directly interacts with the database to fetch data and then display it on the page. Therefore, it doesn't follow the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. However, we can still describe the flow in terms of route, model, and database.

Here is the Mermaid.js sequence diagram that represents the flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant View as appointment-view.php
    participant DB as Database
    User->>View: Accesses page
    View->>DB: SELECT * FROM appo
    DB-->>View: Returns appointment data
    View->>User: Displays appointment data on page
```

This diagram shows that the user accesses the appointment-view.php page, which then queries the database to fetch all appointments. The database returns the appointment data to the view, which then displays this data on the page.

Please note that in a typical MVC architecture, the view would not directly interact with the database. Instead, it would request data from a controller, which would then interact with a model to fetch data from the database. However, this is not the case in the provided PHP file.

%% Diagram 5
The given PHP file is a monolithic script that combines the routing, controller, model, and database operations in a single file. Here is the high-level architecture flow:

- Route: The route is not explicitly defined in the file, but it's implied by the file name `deiete-appointment1.php`. When this file is accessed via a POST request, it triggers the deletion of an appointment.
- Controller: The controller logic is mixed with the model logic in this file. It checks if the request method is POST and if the 'delete' button is clicked. If true, it proceeds to delete the appointment.
- Model: The model is not explicitly defined but is implied in the SQL statement that deletes an appointment from the `appo` table in the database.
- Database: The database operations are performed directly in this file. It connects to the `hospital4` database and executes the delete operation.

Here is the Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Route as deiete-appointment1.php
    participant Controller as Delete Appointment Controller
    participant Model as Appointment Model
    participant DB as hospital4 Database
    Route->>Controller: POST request with appointmentid
    Controller->>Model: Request to delete appointment
    Model->>DB: DELETE FROM appo WHERE appointmentid = ?
    DB-->>Model: Result of delete operation
    Model-->>Controller: Return result
    Controller-->>Route: Return response (message or error)
```

Please note that in a more modern, MVC-based PHP application, the route, controller, model, and database operations would typically be separated into different files or classes.

%% Diagram 6
Based on the provided PHP file, the following high-level architecture flow can be extracted:

1. Route: The user navigates to the delete-appointment.php page.
2. Controller: The PHP code in the file acts as the controller. It handles two types of POST requests: 'showappointment' and 'deleteappointment'.
3. Model: The model is not explicitly defined in a separate file but is represented by the SQL queries within the PHP code. The model interacts with the 'appo' table in the 'hospital4' database.
4. Database: The database is 'hospital4', hosted on a local MySQL server. The specific table being interacted with is 'appo'.

Here is the Mermaid.js sequence diagram representation:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant delete-appointment.php as Controller
    participant SQL as Model
    participant hospital4 as Database
    User->>Controller: Navigate to delete-appointment.php
    Controller->>Model: Prepare SQL query (show or delete)
    Model->>Database: Execute SQL query on 'appo' table
    Database-->>Model: Return query result
    Model-->>Controller: Pass query result
    Controller-->>User: Render page with result data
```

Please note that the PHP script is directly interacting with the database, which is not a recommended practice for larger, more complex applications. In such cases, it would be better to have a separate model layer to handle database operations.

%% Diagram 7
Based on the provided PHP file, the high-level architecture flow can be described as follows:

- Route: delete-doctor.php
- Controller: The PHP code in delete-doctor.php
- Model: Not explicitly defined, but the operations on the 'doctors' table can be considered as the model.
- DB: The MySQL database 'hospital4' with the table 'doctors'

Here is the Mermaid.js format:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Route as delete-doctor.php
    participant Controller as PHP code
    participant Model as doctors table
    participant DB as hospital4 database
    Route->>Controller: HTTP request (POST)
    Controller->>Model: Query (SELECT/DELETE)
    Model->>DB: Execute query
    DB-->>Model: Query result
    Model-->>Controller: Return result
    Controller-->>Route: HTTP response
```

Please note that this is a simplified representation of the flow. The actual flow might involve more steps and components depending on the overall application architecture.

%% Diagram 8
The provided PHP file is a combination of a view and a controller. It directly interacts with the database using SQL queries. There is no explicit model layer in this code. However, we can consider the SQL queries as a model layer for the purpose of this diagram.

Here is the Mermaid.js sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant View as delete-patient.php
    participant DB as Database
    User->>View: Enter Patient ID and click Show/Delete
    View->>DB: SELECT * FROM patient WHERE patientID = 'input'
    DB-->>View: Return patient data
    Note over View: If Show button clicked, display patient data
    Note over View: If Delete button clicked, proceed to delete
    View->>DB: DELETE FROM patient WHERE patientID = 'input'
    DB-->>View: Confirm deletion
    View-->>User: Display success/failure message
```

This diagram shows the flow of data from the user to the view (delete-patient.php), then to the database, and back to the user. The view handles both displaying and deleting patient data based on user input.

%% Diagram 9
The given PHP file is a simple script that connects to a database, retrieves data, and displays it. It does not follow the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, so the route → controller → model → db flow is not applicable here. 

However, we can still describe the flow of operations in this script. Here's a simplified sequence diagram using Mermaid.js format:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Script
    participant Database
    User->>Script: Request (GET)
    Script->>Database: Connect
    Database-->>Script: Connection Established
    Script->>Database: Query (SELECT * FROM patient)
    Database-->>Script: Result Set
    Script->>User: Render HTML with Result Set
```

This sequence diagram represents the flow of operations in the script. The user sends a GET request to the script, the script connects to the database, sends a SQL query to the database, receives the result set from the database, and finally renders an HTML page with the result set to the user.

%% Diagram 10
The provided PHP file is a view file that is responsible for displaying the patient data from the database. It is not a complete MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure, but it does contain elements of it. 

Here's the high-level architecture flow:

- Route: The user accesses the patient-view.php file directly. 
- Controller: The PHP code within the file acts as a controller. It handles the POST request and interacts with the database.
- Model: The model is not explicitly defined, but the SQL query and database interaction can be considered as the model part.
- Database: The database is accessed directly from this file. The database name is 'hospital' and the table name is 'patient'.

The Mermaid.js sequence diagram would look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant View as patient-view.php
    participant Controller as PHP Code
    participant Model as SQL Query
    participant DB as Database
    User->>View: Access patient-view.php
    View->>Controller: POST request (if any)
    Controller->>Model: Execute SQL Query
    Model->>DB: Fetch data from 'patient' table
    DB-->>Model: Return data
    Model-->>Controller: Process data
    Controller-->>View: Display data
    View-->>User: Show patient data
```

Please note that the actual architecture might be different based on how the rest of the application is structured. This is a simplified interpretation based on the provided file.

%% Diagram 11
The provided code is a PHP file that directly interacts with the database. It doesn't follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, so we can't extract a route → controller → model → db flow. However, we can describe the flow of the code as follows:

1. Connect to the database.
2. Check if a POST request is made with a 'search_id'. If yes, fetch the appointment with the corresponding ID from the database. If not, fetch all appointments.
3. Close the database connection.
4. Display the fetched appointments in HTML.

In Mermaid.js format, this can be represented as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Start] --> B[Connect to Database]
B --> C{Check if POST request with 'search_id'}
C -- Yes --> D[Fetch appointment with ID]
D --> E[Close Database Connection]
C -- No --> F[Fetch all appointments]
F --> E
E --> G[Display Appointments in HTML]
G --> H[End]
```

This diagram represents the flow of the PHP script. Please note that this is a simplified representation and actual execution may involve more steps.

%% Diagram 12
The given PHP file is a standalone script that directly interacts with the database. It doesn't follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, hence the route → controller → model → db flow is not applicable here.

However, we can still represent the flow of operations in this script. Here is the Mermaid.js sequence diagram for the script:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Script as update-doctor.php
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Script: POST doctor_id (Show)
    Script->>DB: SELECT * FROM doctors WHERE id = doctor_id
    DB-->>Script: Returns doctor data
    Script-->>User: Display doctor data

    User->>Script: POST updated doctor data (Update)
    Script->>DB: UPDATE doctors SET data WHERE id = doctor_id
    DB-->>Script: Update operation status
    Script-->>User: Display update status
```

This diagram represents two main sequences of operations:

1. The user submits a doctor's ID to fetch the doctor's data. The script executes a SELECT query on the database and displays the data to the user.
2. The user submits updated doctor data. The script executes an UPDATE query on the database and displays the status of the update operation to the user.

%% Diagram 13
Based on the provided PHP file, the high-level architecture flow is as follows:

- The route is `update-patient.php`.
- The controller is embedded in the same PHP file. It handles both GET and POST requests.
- The model is not explicitly defined but can be inferred from the SQL queries. The model is `patient`.
- The database is `hospital`.

Here is the Mermaid.js representation:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Route: update-patient.php]
    B[Controller: Embedded in PHP file]
    C[Model: patient]
    D[Database: hospital]
    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
```

In the sequence diagram format:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Route: update-patient.php
    participant C as Controller: Embedded in PHP file
    participant M as Model: patient
    participant D as Database: hospital
    R->>C: GET/POST request
    C->>M: Process request
    M->>D: SQL query
    D-->>M: Result
    M-->>C: Data
    C-->>R: Response
```

%% Diagram 14
The provided PHP file is a standalone script that directly interacts with the database, bypassing the typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure. Therefore, it doesn't strictly follow the route → controller → model → db flow. However, we can still construct a simplified architecture flow based on the operations performed in the script.

Here's the Mermaid.js sequence diagram format:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant View as view-appointment.php
    participant DB as Database
    User->>View: Request to view appointments
    View->>DB: SELECT * FROM appo
    DB-->>View: Returns appointment data
    View-->>User: Displays appointment data
```

This diagram represents the following flow:

1. The user requests to view appointments.
2. The `view-appointment.php` script queries the database with `SELECT * FROM appo`.
3. The database returns the appointment data to the script.
4. The script then displays the appointment data to the user.

%% Diagram 15
The provided code is a PHP script that directly interacts with the database. It does not follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, so it's not possible to extract a high-level architecture flow in the format of route → controller → model → db. 

However, we can describe the flow of this script as follows:

- The script connects to the database.
- It then executes a SQL query to fetch all doctors from the "doctors" table.
- The results are displayed in an HTML table.
- Finally, the script closes the database connection.

In Mermaid.js format, the flow would look like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Script as PHP Script
    participant DB as Database
    Script->>DB: Connect to Database
    Note over Script,DB: Connection Successful
    Script->>DB: Execute SQL Query (Fetch all doctors)
    DB-->>Script: Return Query Result
    Script->>Script: Display Results in HTML Table
    Script->>DB: Close Database Connection
```

This diagram represents the sequence of operations performed by the PHP script in interaction with the database.

%% Diagram 16
The provided PHP file is a view file, which is part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. However, it doesn't strictly follow the MVC pattern as it mixes the view and the controller responsibilities. 

Here is the high-level architecture flow:

1. Route: The user navigates to the "view-patient.php" page.
2. Controller: The PHP code within the "view-patient.php" file acts as the controller. It handles the POST request when the search form is submitted. It also connects to the database and fetches the patient data.
3. Model: There isn't a distinct model layer in this file. The SQL query to fetch data from the "patient" table acts as a rudimentary model.
4. Database: The database is accessed directly from the controller code. It uses the "patient" table in the "hospital" database.

Here is the Mermaid.js representation:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ViewPatient.php as Controller
    participant Patient as Model
    participant Hospital as Database
    User->>Controller: Navigate to view-patient.php
    Controller->>Database: Connect to hospital database
    Database-->>Controller: Connection established
    User->>Controller: Submit search form (POST)
    Controller->>Model: Query patient data
    Model->>Database: Fetch data from patient table
    Database-->>Model: Return patient data
    Model-->>Controller: Return patient data
    Controller->>User: Display patient data
```

Please note that this diagram simplifies the process and does not include error handling or other potential interactions.
